# Discord-24/7-online

## Usage
* This program keeps your discord account online 24/7. 

## Requirements
* Discord Dummy Account ( Your main and dummy should be mutuals)
* Your Discord Account Token ID (Main Discord Account)
* Cloud IDE(Replit.com, RubyMine, Webstorm, etc)
* Uptime Robot (To ping the replit repository so it doesn't shut down.)

## Step by step on how to run the program:
Create a Replit account and a JavaScript repository.

Clone this repo to the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/D0UT/Discord-24-7-online
```
The environment is now fully set-up

Now, get the Discord Token of your account. Follow the instruction
[here](https://www.followchain.org/find-discord-token/#:~:text=To%20find%20your%20Discord%20token%2C%20you%20need%20to%20open%20Discord,and%20copy%20your%20Discord%20token.).

Once you get the Token ID create a secret variable at your replit repository and name it 'TOKEN'.

Run the program.

Log in to your dummy account. You should now notice your main account is now online.

And the last step is to add your replit repository to uptime robot.
## Configuring Uptime Robot
Go to [Uptime Robot](https://uptimerobot.com)

Sign up for an account.

Navigate to the Monitor dashboard.

Now, select the monitor setup as *HTTP(S)*

Add any name you like but preferably something related.

Put the replit repository url and leave the other settings at default.

Click the Create Monitor button and you're done!
